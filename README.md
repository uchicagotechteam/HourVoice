The `workbench` directory is for work on the Advocate Workbench, and the `user_analysis` directory is for work on detecting fake users / anonymization of users.

I just put the "starter template" example from Bootstrap in the workbench folder, and some random pieces of code from my attempts to learn the `sklearn` Python package.
